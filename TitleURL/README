TitleURL
The TitleURL application shows page titles for user-entered URLs. 

User Interface
TitleURL uses an HTML user interface to accept URLs. To add an extra URL with the same page, click Add URL. TitleURL uses 
UrlVerificationServlet and TitleVerificationBean to store URLs in a Map, then uses the jsoup API to parse the HTML 
associated with each URL and store the page title for each web page. 

User Input Validation
If the user enters an incomplete URL (such as “URLTitleExample.com” instead of “https://www.URLTitleExample.com”) then 
the program attempts to fix the entry by adding feasible options to the beginning (such as “https://www”). If the program 
cannot connect to the web site, it shows the user an error instead of a page title. 

Page Title Display
UrlVerificationServlet stores a String array of page titles in the request scope then forwards all titles to 
valid_page_titles.jsp for display.
